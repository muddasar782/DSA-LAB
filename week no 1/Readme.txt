Templates in C++ enable the creation of generic, reusable functions and classes that can work with different data types and sizes. This approach increases code flexibility and type safety, allowing one implementation to handle multiple types and scenarios without duplication. Other concepts demonstrated include function overloading with templates, class member functions, and handling arrays or structures with parameterized sizes. Additionally, conditional expressions (like the ternary operator) are used within template functions to return values based on comparisons. These features contribute to writing more modular, efficient, and adaptable code.
